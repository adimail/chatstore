I want to build an product chatbot agent that will have access the users cart
history and their personal purchase history. users can ask questions about it,
they can also do things like telling them to apply for return, see ratings,
cancel order, proceed to checkout and among other things.

Each user will have some products. when I tell the AI chatbot to add items in
my cart, do that internally. I want a table for products avaliable and their
quantity. when the products are added by someone in their cart, then do
respective changes across the database. I want a database schema to properly
run the database.
